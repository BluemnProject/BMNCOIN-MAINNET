What is Bluemn?
----------------

BlueMN host plans to provide our investors the one-stop solution for creation and hosting their own masternode with minimal technical knowledge. Our vision is to further help these investors to reduce their risk and manage a more secure and efficient portfolio in identifying all existing and new alternate coins in the crypto-currency space, by providing high-level and detailed reviews which will be available in the next phase of the project. Ultimately as a final product, it is our focus to enhance and develop a secured exchange over masternode where users will have the capability to host, review and trade on our platform.
